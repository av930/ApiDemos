# ApiDemos

## This project is for verifying compile environments in both of Android Studio and Intellj, which are major editors in Android world.

Android Studio is a fork of Intellij and has its own feature fit to Android.
However it functionality of IDE is limited within Android, because it is free.

I know there are a lot of developer is using famous Intellij theseday. 
I can say I am VI guy originally, but one of my biggest hobby is switching IDE from one to others.
please refer : https://github.com/av930/Android_VIM, if you have a favor VIM developing android.

Anyway, I compile Android sample app "ApiDemos" in both of IDEs
and also check if they are running in real device. 

Please refer my work.
