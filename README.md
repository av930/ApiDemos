# ApiDemos

## This project is for verifying compile environments in Android Studio, IntellJ and Eclipse which are major editors in Android world.

Android Studio is a fork of Intellij and add its own feature on it fit to Android.
I installed IntelliJ Communitiy version for this project.
Originally, I learn a language within VI editor, Starting from VI, one of my biggest hobby is switching IDE from one to others.
please refer : https://github.com/av930/Android_VIM, if you have a favor VIM developing android.

Anyway, In this project, I use Android sample app "ApiDemos" and check if they can be executed in real device. 

Please refer my work.
